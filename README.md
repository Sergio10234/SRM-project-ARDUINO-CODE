# SRM-project-ARDUINO-CODE
Arduino lcd and bluetooth code
In this project i used an app creator thunkable.com to create an Bluetooth LE application to communicate with the Arduino Bluetooth HC-05 controller connecting it to the LCD screen. I could send messages with an app created on thunkable.com to my Arduino Plack to the LCD screen that is connected to the Arduino.
